**address** | **String** | The address of the external wallet to connect to the player. | 
**nonce** | **i32** | Any positive integer that hasn't been used previously to connect or disconnect this external wallet. Must be the same nonce used to generate the `signature`. | 
**signature** | **String** | A signature string generated by signing a keccak256 hash generated with abiCoder encode arguments of `[ 'bytes32', 'address', 'bool', 'address', 'uint256' ]` and `[ keccak256(gameId), delegate wallet approved (player's custodial wallet address), true, external wallet address, any unused nonce number ]`. | 
**chain** | **String** | The blockchain you want to support this wallet connection on. If you need to support multiple blockchains, make multiple requests using different `chain` arguments. Support for new blockchains are added over time. |
